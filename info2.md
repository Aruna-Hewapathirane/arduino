# Why Do We Need Major and Minor Numbers in Linux Device Drivers?

In Linux, **device files** in `/dev/` represent access points to hardware. But the **kernel** doesn't use these file paths directly. Instead, it relies on:

- **Major number**: Identifies the **driver** (i.e. which kernel module handles the request).
- **Minor number**: Identifies the **specific device** the driver is managing (e.g. which of several disks or ports).

## ðŸŽ¯ Analogy

Think of this like a **postal system**:

- **Major number** â†’ The **postal service** (e.g., DHL, UPS, FedEx)
- **Minor number** â†’ The **package's tracking number** within that service

So:

| Major | Minor | Device             | Meaning                                  |
|-------|-------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 8     | 0     | `/dev/sda`         | First SATA hard disk                     |
| 8     | 1     | `/dev/sda1`        | First partition on that disk             |
| 188   | 0     | `/dev/ttyUSB0`     | First USB-to-serial device (e.g. FTDI)   |
| 166   | 0     | `/dev/ttyACM0`     | First CDC ACM USB serial (e.g. Arduino)  |

---

## ðŸ”§ Why It Matters

1. **Driver Routing**: When a user program opens `/dev/ttyACM0`, the kernel uses the **major number (166)** to locate the `cdc_acm` driver.
2. **Device Differentiation**: That driver uses the **minor number (e.g. 0, 1, 2)** to figure out *which* of the ACM devices is being accessed.
3. **Scalability**: A single driver can manage **multiple devices**, thanks to minor numbers.

---

## ðŸ§  Summary

- **Major** = *Which driver?*
- **Minor** = *Which device, handled by that driver?*
- Device nodes in `/dev/` are just labels; it's the major/minor numbers that tell the kernel what to do.

You can view a device's major/minor like this:

```bash
ls -l /dev/ttyACM0
# crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Jun  2 09:00 /dev/ttyACM0
