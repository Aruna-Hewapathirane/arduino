Understanding /dev/ttyACM0 and Serial Communication on Linux
============================================================

WHAT IS /dev/ttyACM0?
---------------------
- `/dev/ttyACM0` is a character device file that represents a USB-connected serial device.
- It is typically created by the Linux kernel when you plug in a USB device that uses the
  **CDC-ACM (Communications Device Class - Abstract Control Model)** standard.
- Devices like the Arduino Uno often use this interface to emulate a traditional RS-232
  serial port over USB.

WHAT IS CDC_ACM?
----------------
- `cdc_acm` is a Linux kernel module (driver).
- It enables communication between the system and USB devices that behave like serial ports.
- CDC: Communications Device Class
- ACM: Abstract Control Model (emulates a serial port)

                                           +---------------------------+  

WHY IS /dev/ttyACM0 A CHARACTER DEVICE?
---------------------------------------
- Device files under `/dev` allow user-space programs to interface with kernel-space hardware.
- There are two main types:
  
  Type         | Function                            | Example
  ------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------
  Character    | Sends/receives data byte-by-byte    | `/dev/ttyACM0`
  Block        | Transfers data in blocks (512B, 4KB)| `/dev/sda`, `/dev/nvme0n1`

- Serial ports like `/dev/ttyACM0` transmit data one character (byte) at a time.
- This matches the "character device" paradigm.
- The `ls -l` output:

# Understanding the Unix Philosophy: "Everything is a File"
One of the core philosophies of Unix and Linux is:

"Everything is a file."

This doesn’t just mean documents or scripts — it includes:

Text files
Directories
Hardware devices
Network sockets
Processes (as files in /proc)

# What Does This Mean?
You can interact with hardware the same way you interact with files:

Open a serial port like you open a file.

Read from /dev/ttyUSB0 like you read from a file.

Write to /dev/null to discard output like a sink.

Under the hood, Linux represents many resources as files so that standard system calls (like open(), read(), write()) can be used consistently, regardless of what you’re accessing.

# Where Are These Special Files?
Device files are located in the /dev/ directory.

# Common Examples:
Device File	Description
/dev/sda1	First partition on a hard drive
/dev/ttyACM0	USB serial port (e.g., for Arduino)
/dev/ttyUSB0	USB-to-serial adapter
/dev/ttyS0	Built-in serial port (COM1 equivalent)
/dev/null	Black hole for data (discards all input)

# Types of Device Files
In a long listing (ls -l), the first character tells you what kind of file you're looking at.

# Prefix	Type	Description
-	Regular file	  Text, binary, images, scripts, etc.
d	Directory	      Folder
c	Character device  Data flows one byte/character at a time (e.g. keyboard, serial port)
b	Block device      Data transferred in blocks (e.g. hard drives, SSDs)
l	Symbolic link	  Shortcut to another file

# Let's Inspect a Device File
Check if /dev/ttyACM0 exists and what it is: (I just plugged in my Arduino Uno)
aruna@debian:~$ ls -lh /dev/ttyACM0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 May 25 18:31 /dev/ttyACM0
The leading **c** means it's a character device.
root dialout shows that it's owned by root, and users in the dialout group can access it.
166, 0 are the major and minor device numbers.
